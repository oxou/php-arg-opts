# PHP Argument Parser

This is a quick and easy argument parser that's supposed to be
used for CLI tools.

It's been tested and proven to work, but may have not been tested
_enough_, so take it with a grain of salt.

You are given a single function `arg_opts()` that you can use to
handle parameters from
[$argv](https://www.php.net/manual/en/reserved.variables.argv.php)

Take a look at the **lib.php** for the source code, and see the
**examples** directory for example CLI-like behaving scripts so
you can understand through by practical application.
